* Known bugs/shortcomings:

- parsing the last line of the config file fails if it does not end in
  a newline

- 'set port a bits 0-1 to 3' fails because the last "3" is interpreted
  as a key symbol, not a literal value. ($03 would work correctly
  though)

* Possible features/improvements:

- Think about implementing a timeout for the meta-key that would still
  allow holding down the meta key (e.g. <- is used to fast-forward in
  rsidplay)

- Allow defining/recording/playback of keyboard macros

- Allow redefining the matrix (eg switch y and z for qwertz-Layouts)

  This could be as simple as implementing a swap command as an inital
  command, e.g. "swap z y" for qwertz

- Allow key chords (multiple keys), 
  e.g. META... k-1 = select kernal one
       META... c-1 = select charset one
       META... m-1 = select mixer one

- Allow typing via USB (?)

  This would mean pulling in the whole vusb stuff, implementing client
  side code, etc...

- Allow typing via the serial interface (?)

  This would make the interface much more complicated...  Why would we
  need this? E.g. to allow an additional keyboard-controller to relay
  keys to the C64 (numpad))

* Possible applications:

  - Do resets on a keypress/command
  - switch kernals, then issue resets
  - keep the reset line low after powerup until special 
    key combo is hit ("password protection")
  - Implement buttons, e.g. for an internal SDIEC
