* Possible features/improvements:

- expect command keys only during keydown of meta key:
  
  This has the advantage of not having to press the key twice to relay
  it -- it would relay the key when the key goes up again without a
  command key having been pressed during keydown... which would make
  its special function almost unnoticeable when typing regulary...

  Also this would allow holding the key down and issuing multiple
  commands in sequence, very handy for counters, and more user friendly
  in general.

- Allow defining/recording/playback of keyboard macros

- Allow redefining the matrix (eg switch y and z for qwertz-Layouts)

  This could be as simple as implementing a swap command as an inital
  command, e.g. "swap z y" for qwertz

- Allow key chords (multiple keys), 
  e.g. META... k-1 = select kernal one
       META... c-1 = select charset one
       META... m-1 = select mixer one

- Allow typing via USB (?)

  This would mean pulling in the whole vusb stuff, implementing client
  side code, etc...

- Allow typing via the serial interface (?)

  This would make the interface much more complicated...
  Why would we need this?

* Possible applications:

  - Do resets on a keypress/command
  - switch kernals, then issue resets
  - keep the reset line low after powerup until special 
    key combo is hit ("password protection")
  - Implement buttons, e.g. for an internal SDIEC
