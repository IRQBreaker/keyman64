# first two bytes define the binding:

# byte 0: key or command
#         00-77 = key spec (high nibble = column, low nibble = row)
#         78-FD = predefined command(s) (can be jumped to or be called from the c64)
#         FE = initial command (port setup)
#         FF = end of config
# byte 1: number of commands following
#
# 3 bytes for each command:
#
# byte 0: bits 6-0: action:
#         00 = SET,
#	  01 = INVERT,
#         02 = INCREASE,

#
#         bit 7: which port to affect: 0 = PORT A, 1 = PORTB
