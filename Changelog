Version 1.6 - Sep 10, 2017
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Software/Firmware:

- Implemented support for expansion of control lines via multiple
  daisy chained 74595 serial shift registers. Additional registers
  will appear as additional virtual ports c, d, e etc. and can be used
  like the native ports a and b. The only limitation is that the
  expanded ports can not be set to tristate.

- Implemented the corresponding "expand" configuration directive to
  configure port expansion, specifying the number of additional ports
  and the location of the required control lines on the native ports.

- Improved update command for updates that require regeneration of
  binary configuration data. The update command accepts an optional
  second argument specifying the location of a configuration file.

- Added "speed" command to configure either slow or fast keyboard
  scanning. Slow scanning is necessary for long keyboard cables, as in
  the SX64 (reported by Davide Gustin)

- Added commands to control the keyboard matrix directly from USB

- Added new serial command to set control lines directly

- Added new serial command to type a PETSCII character

- Added USB command to reset the device, implemented reset command for
  the client utility

- Allow multiple map commands for the same key

- Added early scan and relay step on power up to allow cartridges to
  see key presses early on during their startup sequence (reported by
  Gero Ihde)

- Fixed bug in symbol parsing where all lines containing equal signs
  were interpreted as symbol definitions (reported by Sven Arke)

- Fixed bugs in internal print routine

- Added bash completion support

Build system:

- Fixed build errors/warnings on MacOSX/clang (missing fmemopen())
- Fixed definition of sleep() for all build environments
- Fill binary firmware image with 0xff up to 128k
- Adjusted assembler sources for KickAssembler 4.x

Note:

This update breaks binary compatibility for existing configuration
data on the device. Please follow these instructions to perform the
update:

     1. Update the keyman64 client utility first

     2. Use the new two-argument form of the update command to update
        the firmware:

        $ keyman64 update keyman64-application-1.6.hex my.conf

	where "my.conf" should point to your configuration file.

This will first delete the current configuration on the device, then
update the firmware and after that regenerate your configuration and
finally transfer the new configuration to the device.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.5 - Feb 22, 2017
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Software/Firmware:

- The utility command "update" now also accepts firmware updates in
  Intel HEX format.

- The "--preserve" option for the utility command "convert" has been
  deprecated. It is no longer required since saved state is now stored
  outside of the configuration.

- The command line client now shows usage information when called
  without arguments. In order to read commands from standard input,
  use "-" as the single argument.

- The windows version of the command line client now detects when the
  user double clicks on the execu table instead of using it
  interactively from the command prompt. An informative message is
  shown and the cmd window is kept open until the user presses a key.

- New commands "password" and "lock" implement password protected
  keyboard locking. When "lock" is executed, the keyboard is locked
  until the password previously defined using the "password" command
  is entered.

- In addition, the predefined slots "LOCKED" and "UNLOCKED" have been
  added. These allow the user to run additional keyman64 commands
  before the keyboard is locked or unlocked.

- New commands "memorize" and "recall" have been added. These commands
  are similar to save and restore except that the state is not
  permanently saved to EEPROM memory but temporarily saved to SRAM.

- Fixed the "--identify" command line option

- Fixed a bug that would leave trailing whitespace in symbol values
  when adding a comment to the line after the value part

Upgrade instructions:

Upgrading from version 1.3 or earlier:

Please first upgrade to version 1.4 following the instructions for
version 1.4 further down in this document.

Upgrading from version 1.4:

    1. Upgrade the command line utility on your PC
    2. Download the new firmware image
    3, Connect the keyman64 via USB and power on the C64
    4, On your PC, run

       $ keyman64 update keyman64-application-1.5.hex

If you have previously saved control line state using the save
command, please note that the saved state is lost during this upgrade.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.4 - Nov 17, 2016
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Licensing:

- Hardware is now licensed under CERN OHL v1.2
- Software and Firmware are now licensed under GNU GPLv3
- V-USB driver has been properly sublicenced under GPLv3, see
  README.txt for details

Bootloader:

- Reconfigured to create a working bootloader again
- Modified to allow a reset from firmware that does not trigger the
  bootloaderCondition() (using a magic value at the end of Eeprom).

Software/Firmware:

- Added "configure" command to the configuration utility, allowing to
  directly convert and flash a configuration file to eeprom via USB,
  without having to use avrdude and without having to enter the
  bootloader beforehand
- Added an "update" command that can be used to update the firmware,
  likewise without requiring avrdude and manual bootloader entry
- Changed string literal syntax to allow typing all PETSCII characters
  that can be typed on a real keyboard using the "type" command
- Introduced escape sequences \r, \n, \f (return, newline, form feed),
  \xhh and \x{ddd} numeric sequences, deprecated use of ~ for return
- Changed serial interface, using byte instead of nibble for commands
- Allow serial interface commands with more than one argument
- Added command to map a control line as active-low input to trigger a
  user defined key press, i.e. ability to add additional "keys"
- Added serial interface command to create/change mappings directly
- Added directive to require more than one invocation of a keybinding
  before actually executing bound commands
- Added command "version" to type out embedded firmware version info
- Added command "status" to type out current control port status
- Added client option --identify to fetch firmware info via USB
- Added key name SHIFT as a synonym for LEFTSHIFT
- Eliminated bogus USB error message when entering bootloader via USB
- Removed possibility of random cursor movement while executing long
  running intial commands
- Fixed client exit code when failing to open USB device
- Improved build system, added example.conf
- Improved fallback configuration

Notes:

The client utility, the bootloader and the firmware need to be
upgraded in lockstep. The easiest way to do this is to flash the
combined application and bootloader hex or bin file to the Atmega
using an external programmer. Then recreate and reflash your
configuration to eeprom memory.

If you don't have a programmer, you will need to upgrade using the
following procedure:

    1. Install the new command line utility

    2. Enter the bootloader, e.g. by running

       $ keyman64 boot

    3. Install the updater application for the bootloader:

       $ avrdude -p m1284p -c usbasp -U flash:w:keyman64-bootloader-updater-1.4.hex:h

    4. Wait a few seconds to allow the update of the bootloader to finish

    5. Press the reset button on the Keyman64 while holding down the boot
       button to manually enter the bootloader.

    6. Recreate and reflash your configuration:

       $ keyman64 convert keyman64.conf keyman64.bin
       $ avrdude -p m1284p -c usbasp -U eeprom:w:keyman64.bin:r

    7. Enter the bootloader again as described in 5.

    8. Reinstall the keyman64 application:

       $ avrdude -p m1284p -c usbasp -U flash:w:keyman64-application-1.4.hex:h

In addition, all existing "type" commands using the tilde character
(~) for return will need to be adjusted, i.e. replace tilde with \r.

The serial interface now expects a complete byte for the command
instead of a nibble. The provided serial.asm file has been adjusted
accordingly, clients using the interface will have to be
rebuild/adjusted as well.

only the firmware needs to be upgraded.
